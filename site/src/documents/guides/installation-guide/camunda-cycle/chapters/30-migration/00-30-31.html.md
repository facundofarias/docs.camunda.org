title: 'Migrate from 3.0 to 3.1'
category: 'Migration'

---

We updated the database schema of camunda Cycle in the version 3.1.0. So please update your database schema using the migration scripts provided in the `sql/upgrade` folder of the camunda cycle distribution:

```
camunda-cycle-distro-$CYCLE_VERSION.zip/sql/upgrade/*_cycle_3.0_to_3.1.sql
```

There is an individual SQL script for each supported database. Select the script appropriate for your database and run it with your database administration tool (e.g. SqlDeveloper for Oracle).

<div class="alert alert-info">
  If you have not got the distro at hand, you can also download a file that packages these
  scripts from our <a href="https://app.camunda.com/nexus/content/groups/public/org/camunda/bpm/cycle/camunda-cycle-sql-scripts/3.1.0/camunda-cycle-sql-scripts-3.1.0.jar">server</a>.
