###Install camunda BPM platform

First, download a distribution of the camunda BPM platform. You can choose from different distrubitions for various application servers. In this tutorial, we will use the Apache Tomcat 7 based distribution. Download it [here](http://camunda.org/download). Make sure you choose a version >= 7.2.0.

After having downloaded the distribution, unpack it inside a directory of your choice. We will call that directory `$CAMUNDA_HOME`.

After you have successfully unpacked your distribution of the camunda BPM platform, execute the script named `start-camunda.bat` (for Windows users), respectively `start-camunda.sh` (for Unix users).

This script will start the application server and open a welcome screen in your Web browser. If the page does not open, go to [http://localhost:8080/camunda-welcome/index.html](http://localhost:8080/camunda-welcome/index.html).
