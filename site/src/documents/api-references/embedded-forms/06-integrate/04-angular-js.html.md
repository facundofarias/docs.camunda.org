## Including the Angular Distribution

Make sure you include the angular JS build of the Forms SDK:

```html
<script src="angular.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="camunda-bpm-sdk-angular.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

## Loading the Forms Module

Add the Forms SDK as module dependency to your application
module:

```javascript
angular.bootstrap(window.document, ['cam.embedded.forms', ...]);
```


## Angular Directives & Compilation

If the form is loaded from an URL, the SDK makes sure that it is properly compiled and linked to the current angular scope. This allows using angular directives in forms loaded dynamically at runtime.

```html
<form role="form" name="form">

<input type="text"
       cam-variable-name="CUSTOMER_ID"
       cam-variable-type="String"
       ng-model="customerId">

<p ng-show="customerId">Your input: <em>{{customerId}}</em></p>

</form>
```
